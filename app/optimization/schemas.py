"""Stable HELIOS-side schemas for the optimization-intelligence layer.

These dataclasses are the *contract* between HELIOS and any optimization
provider (Nexus or local).  They deliberately reference only HELIOS's own
types (``ParameterSpace``, ``Observation``) so Nexus's internal objects never
leak across the boundary -- the two codebases stay decoupled and the provider
implementation can change without rippling through HELIOS.
